                    Prithvi cafe makes me feel nostalgic about our college days when we came here quite often, it was our “Adda” and even now it is.
                    It’s the best cafe with fanatic dishes served at minimum price and the ambience is amazing too.
                    Best place for dates and even better for buddies-day-out. Every dish on their menu are highly delectable and we have probably tried everything that’s available.
                    They serve ultimate “Chai” which is one of the must-have here.
                    We’d recommend to try
                    Pasta,
                    Spaghetti,
                    Cheese balls,
                    Biryani,
                    Pizza,
                    Milkshakes,
                    Layered cake.

            In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block. In 2015, they established the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in order to research other options for its product and packaging. “There is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several factors influence the environmental sustainability of a material – the composition of the material, how it is sourced and what happens when the product reaches the end of its life. When we search for new materials all of these factors must be considered,” said Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and President of the LEGO Group. One material that has been floated as a possible alternative has been hemp. 420 Magazine motivated in their article that hemp could be a good.

            A new report finds that the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010. The fires that raged across the Brazilian Amazon this summer were not 'normal' and large increases in deforestation could explain why, scientists show.
